# BSC Applications

### What is BSC Applications?

To put it simply, BSC Applications is a multiuse app made for Windows 10 using [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide). We wanted to show the world how good multiuse apps can be. Currently as of 0.0.0 BSC Applications comes with a Rich Text Editor(Text Edit), Photo View, and Phone Book(Work in progress).

### How do I help Develop BSC Applications?

Simply download the code and add or fix what you want to. Then upload the file and we will review it and decide if it should be in the text version. If we decided that it is worthy to be in the next version we will approve it and recompile our code to use the new feature.
**NOTE You will need to give a very short description on what this new feature does and why we should add it.**
